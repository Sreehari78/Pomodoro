# Pomodoro
The Pomodoro Technique was developed in the late 1980s by then university student Francesco Cirillo. When your session ends, mark off one pomodoro and record what you completed. Then enjoy a five-minute break. After four pomodoros, take a longer, more restorative 15-30 minute break. This app is inspired by this technique where the work lasts for 25 mins with short breaks of 5 min and long breaks of 20 min.
